# Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.

### Key Features:
- **Convolutional Layers:** Apply convolution operations to input data to detect features.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce the dimensionality of data, retaining important features.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, typically at the end of the network.

### Applications:
- Image and video recognition
- Image classification
- Object detection

## Datasets:
Create dataset from: [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)
